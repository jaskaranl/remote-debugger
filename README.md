Live Debugger is a powerful and user-friendly debugging tool designed to help developers identify and resolve issues in their code during runtime. It offers a real-time view of variables and other crucial information while the code is executing, allowing developers to gain valuable insights into the program's behavior.
# Features
* Real-time Variable Monitoring: Monitor the values of variables as they change during program execution, helping you spot unexpected behavior or identify the cause of errors.
* Breakpoints: Set breakpoints in your code to pause execution at specific points. This feature lets you examine the program state precisely when it matters the most.
* Step-by-Step Execution: Step through your code line-by-line to observe its behavior at each step and pinpoint issues more efficiently.
* Expressions Evaluation: Evaluate expressions and watch their values update dynamically during runtime, helping you verify complex calculations and conditions.
* Exception Handling: Catch and examine exceptions as they occur, assisting you in identifying the cause of errors and improving the overall stability of your code.
